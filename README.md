## How To Ask a Coding Question
Before asking a coding question on [Discord](https://howtocodewell.net/discord) please read the following:
1. Please check [Google](https://google.com) or [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) first
If you can't find the solution then please use the coding-help channel in the [Discord server](https://howtocodewell.net/discord).
When writing your question please do the following:
1. State the problem or desired goal. 
2. For larger code files, limit the code you post to the targeted issue
3. Add any log messages that you think are relevant
4. Use 3x backticks before and after your code to format it See below:

## Formatting code when asking for code help

Please write your code in a code block. 

1) Single lines/words/`inline code`.

Wrap the code in single back ticks ' \`  <YOUR_CODE>  \` ' like this:
` $this->isWrappedInSingleBackTicks()`

2) Multiple lines:

Wrap multiple lines of code in three back ticks ' \`\`\` <YOUR__LONGER__CODE> \`\`\` ' like this:
```
function thisIsWrappedInThreeBackTicks() {
         return [
                'formatted_code' => 'is_easier_to_read'
        ]
}
```

3) Highlight your syntax

Add the programming language to the first back ticks ` ````php ```` ` like this:
```php
function thisIsWrappedInThreeBackTicks() {
         return [
                'formatted_code' => 'is_easier_to_read'
        ]
}
```
Or  ` ````css ```` `
```css
.howToCodeWell{
   display:block
}
```
Or  ` ````js ```` `
```javascript
const website = howtocodewell.net
const podcast = howtocodewell.fm

console.log(website)
console.log(podcast)
```
4) To create a new line hold down shift and press enter. Holding the shift key will prevent the message from being sent and it will put your cursor on the next line.
